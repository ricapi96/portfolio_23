      <p>
        Hi there! I'm Erica, a passionate frontend developer with a love for nature and animals. My journey began when I pursued a degree in computer science and engineering, where I gained a strong foundation in coding and problem-solving.

      <p>
        When I'm not crafting pixel-perfect interfaces, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, often accompanied by my furry friends. I believe that just as in coding, attention to detail and adaptability are essential when trekking new paths and discovering hidden gems.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my downtime, I'm an avid traveler, seeking inspiration from diverse cultures and landscapes. When I'm not on the road, I'm likely immersed in the virtual worlds of video games, where creativity and strategy come together in exciting ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm excited to combine my technical skills with my passion for design to create intuitive user experiences that make a positive impact. Let's build something amazing together!
